## Hello, world!

I am [Kirill Vasiltsov](https://www.kirillvasiltsov.com/) and I am a UI developer at [Yumemi](https://yumemi.co.jp/).  
Currently I'm working on the user interface of a *very popular* EC website.

🛠 For my everyday tasks I use Javascript, Typescript and React  
🧪 At the moment I am learning and experimenting with Web Animations and Rust

## Activity

📝 I [write](https://www.kirillvasiltsov.com/writing) about things I find interesting   
🌏 I often contribute to OSS projects and build mine (see below)  
💪 I value open-mindedness, intellectual honesty and questioning status quo.

## Non-tech

I am very interested in Stoicism and applying it to the modern times. You can find some of the ideas in my blog.
